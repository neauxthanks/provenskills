#Here is where you can define all of your states in a clever way to make your code more readable.
#Think of all the states your robot could be in if thrown randomly into a world.
#Currently the code is set up for a variable name being equal to an integer like:

FOLLOWING = 1           
HIT_THE_WALL = 2    # facing the wall
CROOKED = 3         # meaning its not in a convenient angle 
CENTRAL = 4         # not particularly close to the wall // must find closest wall



#for each of your states.
