HOW TO RUN: please use $roslaunch wall_follower wall_follower.launch

This will launch all three of the nodes correctly if they are marked as executable.

PLEASE INCLUDE THE REST OF THE README HERE

While the robot can detect a wall, it will attempt to follow the wall until it crashes due to turning a corner. No other action is needed from the user.
